  author: "User123",
  topic: "Trading fees",
  content: "Post content here...",
  sentiment: "positive|negative|neutral",
  requestType: "feature_request|bug_report|question|feedback|complaint|praise",

  tags: ["trading_fees", "urgent"]
}
```

## Customization

### Adding Real Data Sources

Currently, the app uses mock data for demonstration. To connect real data sources:

1. **Edit** `src/utils/dataCollector.js`
2. **Modify** the `fetchCommunityPosts` function
3. **Replace** mock data generation with actual API calls or web scraping

Example:
```javascript
export const fetchCommunityPosts = async (options = {}) => {
  const response = await axios.get('YOUR_API_ENDPOINT', {
    params: options
  });
  return response.data;
}
```

### Customizing Theme Colors

Edit `tailwind.config.js` to change brand colors:
```javascript
colors: {
  'comdirect': {
    'yellow': '#FFD500',  // Your brand yellow
    'blue': '#003C71',    // Your brand blue
    'dark': '#001E3C',    // Your brand dark
  }
}
```

## Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The optimized build will be in the `dist/` directory, ready for deployment.

## Preview Production Build

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Browser Support

- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)

## Important Notes

### Data Privacy
- All data is stored locally in browser localStorage
- No data is sent to external servers in the default configuration
- Ensure compliance with data protection regulations when collecting real user data
- Always respect user privacy and terms of service

### Scraping Considerations
- Check comdirect's Terms of Service before scraping
- Consider using official APIs if available
- Implement rate limiting to avoid server overload
- Only collect public data
- Respect robots.txt guidelines

### Performance
- The app handles thousands of posts efficiently
- For very large datasets (>10,000 posts), consider pagination
- Charts may take longer to render with extensive data

## Future Enhancements

Potential features to add:
- Real-time data streaming
- Advanced NLP for better sentiment analysis
- Export to PDF/Excel formats
- Multi-language support
- User authentication and role management
- Custom dashboard widgets
- Automated reporting
- Email alerts for trending issues
- Integration with customer support systems
